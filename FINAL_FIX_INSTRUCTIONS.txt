🎯 HOW TO FIX "ALREADY REGISTERED" ERROR
========================================

THE PROBLEM:
Email is stored in your browser's localStorage

THE SOLUTION (3 EASY STEPS):
========================================

STEP 1: CLICK "Clear & Retry" BUTTON
------
You see this button right on the signup form
Just click it once!

What it does:
- Deletes ALL data from browser storage
- Clears the form fields completely
- Removes the error message
- Makes form ready for new signup


STEP 2: ENTER A FRESH EMAIL
------
After clicking "Clear & Retry":
- Name field is EMPTY ← type a name
- Email field is EMPTY ← type a NEW email (NOT aa@f)
- Password field is EMPTY ← type a password
- No error message showing ← page is clean!


STEP 3: CLICK "Create account"
------
Now click the green "Create account" button
It will work! ✅


IMPORTANT TIPS:
========================================

⚠️  Use a DIFFERENT email than before!
   - Don't use "aa@f" - that was cached
   - Try: "test@example.com" or "abc@def.com"
   - Anything different from what failed


✅ The form will be completely empty
   - No old values will be there
   - All localStorage is deleted
   - It's like a fresh page


📱 Check your browser Console (F12)
   - You'll see lots of emoji logs
   - Look for green ✅ = good
   - Look for red ❌ = error


WHAT TO DO IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK:
========================================

1. Make sure you're using a DIFFERENT email
   ✗ Bad: using "aa@f" again
   ✓ Good: using "newtest@email.com"

2. Wait a few seconds after clicking "Clear & Retry"
   - Toast message says "✅ Storage Cleared!"
   - THEN fill the form

3. Open Console (F12) and look for errors
   - Screenshot the red error messages
   - Let me know what it says


STEP-BY-STEP RIGHT NOW:
========================================

1. You're on signup page
2. See error: "This email is already registered..."
3. See button: "Clear & Retry"
4. CLICK THE BUTTON → Page updates
5. See toast: "✅ Storage Cleared!"
6. Form is now BLANK (name, email, password all empty)
7. Fill in form with NEW EMAIL
8. Click "Create account"
9. SUCCESS! ✅


STILL STUCK?
========================================

Try the NUCLEAR option - manual browser clear:

1. Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete (or Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac)
2. Select "Cookies and site data"
3. Check the site: http://localhost:5173 (or your URL)
4. Click "Clear"
5. Close tab and reopen: http://localhost:5173/signup
6. Now try signing up


REMEMBER:
========================================
- Clear & Retry button clears EVERYTHING
- Form becomes completely blank
- You can use same email NOW (it's cleared)
- OR use a different email - either works!
