🎯 YOUR DATABASE PROBLEM IS SOLVED! 
===========================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
-------------------
✗ MySQL service is STOPPED
✓ MySQL is installed correctly
✓ All setup files are ready
✓ Node server is running


THE SOLUTION (3 SIMPLE STEPS):
===========================================

📍 STEP 1: START MYSQL SERVICE
-------------------------------
Open Windows Explorer and navigate to:
  C:\Users\ADITYA\Downloads\dream-weaver-main (1)\Pharmac\database

Find this file:
  START_MYSQL_ADMIN.bat

RIGHT-CLICK it and choose:
  "Run as administrator"

You'll see a command window. Wait for:
  "SUCCESS! MySQL is now running"


📍 STEP 2: CREATE DATABASE TABLES
-------------------------------
1. Open MySQL Workbench (from Start menu)

2. You should see "Pharmac Local" connection
   - If not, click the + button:
     * Connection Name: Pharmac Local
     * Hostname: localhost
     * Port: 3306
     * Username: root
   - Double-click to connect
   - Enter your MySQL root password

3. In MySQL Workbench menu:
   File → Open SQL Script...

4. Navigate and select:
   C:\Users\ADITYA\Downloads\dream-weaver-main (1)\Pharmac\database\setup-database-workbench.sql

5. Click the lightning bolt (⚡) icon at top
   OR press Ctrl+Shift+Enter

6. You should see:
   "Database setup completed successfully!"
   A table showing 6 tables created

7. In left sidebar:
   - Click the refresh icon (🔄)
   - Expand "pharmac_db"
   - You'll see 6 tables:
     • agent_activities
     • queries  
     • reports
     • results
     • users
     • visual_insights


📍 STEP 3: SET YOUR MYSQL PASSWORD
-------------------------------
1. In VS Code, open file:
   .env

2. Find this line:
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=

3. Change it to (use YOUR actual password):
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_real_mysql_password

4. Save the file (Ctrl+S)


📍 STEP 4: RESTART YOUR APP
-------------------------------
1. In VS Code terminal, press: Ctrl+C
2. Run: npm run dev
3. Look for this message:
   "Using MySQL storage (mysql2)"


VERIFY IT WORKS:
===========================================
✓ MySQL Workbench shows all 6 tables
✓ Server says "Using MySQL storage (mysql2)"  
✓ Signup/Login works
✓ No more "tables not found" errors


ADDITIONAL TOOLS PROVIDED:
===========================================
✓ CHECK_SETUP.ps1 - Diagnostic tool
✓ START_MYSQL_ADMIN.bat - Easy MySQL starter
✓ setup-database-workbench.sql - Complete DB setup
✓ DATABASE_QUICK_FIX.txt - Quick reference
✓ SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.txt - Detailed guide


TROUBLESHOOTING:
===========================================

Q: MySQL service won't start?
A: 1. Open Services (Windows+R → services.msc)
   2. Find MySQL80
   3. Right-click → Properties
   4. Click "Start" button
   5. If error, try "Restart"

Q: Can't connect in MySQL Workbench?
A: 1. Verify MySQL service is running
   2. Check your root password
   3. Use localhost not 127.0.0.1
   4. Port must be 3306

Q: Tables still don't show?
A: 1. Make sure you ran setup-database-workbench.sql
   2. Click refresh (🔄) in schemas panel
   3. Expand "pharmac_db" schema
   4. If still empty, run script again

Q: App still uses JSON storage?
A: 1. Check .env file has correct password
   2. Restart node server completely
   3. Check server logs for errors


WHAT I FIXED FOR YOU:
===========================================
✓ Cleared duplicate users from server/users.json
✓ Fixed signup error handling
✓ Improved error messages
✓ Created START_MYSQL_ADMIN.bat for easy service start
✓ Created setup-database-workbench.sql with all tables
✓ Created CHECK_SETUP.ps1 diagnostic tool
✓ Verified .env file exists
✓ Created comprehensive documentation


THE ROOT CAUSE:
===========================================
Your MySQL service was STOPPED. When MySQL is not 
running, the application falls back to JSON file 
storage (server/users.json). That's why you couldn't 
see any tables in MySQL Workbench - the database 
server wasn't even running!

Keep MySQL service running to use the database.


NEED HELP?
===========================================
Run this diagnostic anytime:
  database\CHECK_SETUP.ps1

Read detailed guides:
  • DATABASE_QUICK_FIX.txt
  • SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.txt  
  • MYSQL_SETUP_GUIDE.md


You're all set! Just follow the 4 steps above.
The files are ready, MySQL is installed, you just
need to start the service and run the setup script.
